1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when there is many people work for a project and then should share their code every day.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If we use auto sync, we can lose the track of version of code. So we should pull changes manually.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks: it only used in github, and when you have no permission to commit code on original project. But you want to share your code, so you can fork other people's code.

clones: when you want to copy a repository from local or server, you should use clones.

branches: when you want to make some changed in code in current repository, but you don't want changed the master code.

4.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
We can find the difference between local commit with server commit.
